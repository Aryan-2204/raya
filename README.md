So basically its my first mini project a stepping stone of my web-dev journey.
I have created here is a responsive html page with css styling.
This site of Raya web design has home page , About page , Services page.

HOME PAGE:
Header has container class and can be used again ,classes made for easy styling,
Id created branding to target that part ,span .highlight used to apply style for specific portion.
The created some nav links (a href="") -> direct links.
Next I created a section called showcase which will have text and background image through background:url( ) 
then i created asection called newsletter which has a form input type:> and a button.
created another section of boxes and added class container and box to all boxes so that styling can be easy
and at last made the footer.

ABOUT PAGE : 
The header has same contetns as home page but have 
integrated articles in the section with aside -(sidebar)
and footer at end.

SERVICE PAGE:
The header is same as above but the section has different paragraphs with adding a form in aside 
form contains : <label> and <input Type ="">
then the footer at last.

CSS
css is involved in the files through linking (externally) for neatness 
float is to float contetn left or right,overflow :hidden does not let scroll bar appear
id's are dealt with # and class has .


To make the site responsive we have to use @media(max-width:768px) and then style the html accordingly like doing text aligning 
removing float and adding padding to the site to look responsive.
